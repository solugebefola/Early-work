# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# colors = %w[red green blue yellow]
# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
# colors.zip(numbers).each do |(color, num)|
# a = Band.create!(name: "The band #{color}")
#
# 5.times do |t|
#
# b = Album.create!(name: "The album #{t} from band #{color}",
#               band_id: a.id,
#               live_vs_studio: "L")
# 5.times do |a|
# Track.create!(name: "Track #{a},album #{t}, band #{color}",
#               album_id: b.id,
#               lyrics: "Doo waah")
#
#     end
#   end
